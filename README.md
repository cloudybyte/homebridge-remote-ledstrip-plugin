[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) GPIO based LED Strip plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

Originally inspired by [GiniaE/homebridge-gpio-ledstrip](https://github.com/GiniaE/homebridge-gpio-ledstrip) and [manfredipist/homebridge-gpio-rgb-ledstrip](https://github.com/manfredipist/homebridge-gpio-rgb-ledstrip) and base plugin taken from [suhajda3/homebridge-rgb-ledstrip](https://github.com/suhajda3/homebridge-rgb-ledstrip)

# Installation

1.	[Install Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki) on your host 
2.	Install this plugin `npm install -g homebridge-remote-ledstrip-plugin` (on the host)
3.	Run `sudo pigpiod` after installing [the pigpio library](https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/) and Python (on slave)
4. Optionally install [Homebridge Config UI X](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x)

# Hardware
